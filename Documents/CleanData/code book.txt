These are the parameters in the dataset and their values:
subject: subject id 1-30
activity: activity id with their lables:
1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING


all the following are the variables being measured, the dataset attached gives you the MEAN for each and every one of the following variables:
Those that are labeled with "mean" are the mean of the varaible for this subject for this activity
The X, Y, Z refers to the axys in which the varaible is being measured
The Acc refers to the embedded acceleromete in the wearable 
The Gyro refers to the embedded gyroscope
There is some reference to the Gravity frequency, but apparently it didn't have much affect (in the Gravity parameters)
